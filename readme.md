# An open-source guide to Computer Science
Hey, the end-goal for this repository is to create a libre & gratis college level course that explains computer science to any degree transfers.

## Goal
To teach the similarities amongst programming languages.

## Approach
Will implement similar sample project in many different programming language with the goal of show-casing the main differences between the principal programming language & end-user targets.

### Targets
Since we are developers, we'll be targeting the console for the first few programs. The idea is to increase our tools & libraries as we progress & acquire greater knowledge. Linux, Remote Control & Version Control will be taught
